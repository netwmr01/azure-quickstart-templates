# This script will walk you through setting up BIND on the host and making the changes needed in
# Azure portal.
#

#
# WARNING
#
# - This script only creates one zone file which supports <= 255 hosts. It has not been tested
#   with > 255 hosts trying to use the same zone file. It "might just work", or it may require
#   manually configuring additional zone files in `/etc/named/named.conf.local` and
#   `/etc/named/zones/`.
# - It is assumed that the Azure nameserver IP address will always be `168.63.129.16`. See more
#   info: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mast/2015/05/18/what-is-the-ip-address-168-63-129-16/.
